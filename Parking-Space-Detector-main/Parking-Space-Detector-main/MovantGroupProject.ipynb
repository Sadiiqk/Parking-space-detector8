    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will develop a parking space detection system using the __STM32Cube IDE__ and __STM32 microcontrollers__. Our main __objective__ is to create an intelligent solution that enhances the parking experience for drivers, optimizes space utilization, and contributes to a smarter and more sustainable urban environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's rapidly growing society, finding available parking spots can be a time-consuming and frustrating task for drivers, leading to congestion and wasted resources. To address this issue, we will integrate smart technologies into parking management. One such technology includes implementation of parking space detection systems, which uses embedded software and sensors to monitor the occupancy status of any parking spaces in real-time. To be able to achieve this, we will use mathematical algorithms to measure different areas and points in a parking space as well as interact with I/O pins for sensors using our microcontroller STM32F401RETx -NUCLEO-F401RE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key objectives:\n",
    "* __Sensor Integration__ - We will be using ultrasonic sensor for this project. It can accurately measure distances making them suitable for detecting the presence of vehicles in parking spaces.\n",
    "* __Real-time Data Processing__ - Developing algorithms for real-time data processing. We will explore how to analyze sensor data to determine parking space occupancy and availability. The software will be designed to make informed decisions based on the sensor readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to be able to have hands-on experience for embedded software developer students to learn their skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration and real-time data processing. Secondly, to address a real-world problem with a technology-driven solution. As cities continue to grow, the demand for efficient parking management increases  and hopefully with our system it will alleviate this challenge by providing an accurate and reliable parking space occupancy information.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, our goal is to have a fully functional parking space detection system that showcases the capabilities of STM32CUBE IDE. This project not only provides valuable practical experience in embedded software development but also contributes to the advancement of smart city technologies.\n",

    "## Diary\n",
    "\n",
    "__Day 1__: We discussed which platform that were convenient and best for our project and made a decision to use STM32CUBE IDE. Then, we started discussing about different functions that should be included in this project e.g., LEDs to set the status of vacancy/occupation of a parking space and so forth. Afterwards, we then generated our code from STM32 after setting I/O pins for our sensor and LEDs into VSCode. Before the meeting ended, we decided that we each should come up with an algorithm solution for detecting parking space using the ultrasonic sensor and to bring them up in our next meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Day 2__: Today was a bit challenging, because setting up multiple functions for a parking space detector to start off with e.g. Initialize parking space size using array etc. wasn't easy to begin with, we have to be creative with our ideas, but after a long well thought discussion and _ALOT_ of _code testing_ we finally managed to get a working code! Not gonna complain. We thought that ultrasonic sensor algorithm to measure distance between the sensor and the car was gonna be postponed until the next day as we need to do more research.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Day 3__: We initialized our sensor, trigger and echo pins. We unfortunately ran into some code errors and asked Ludwig for assistance. No data sheet = No idea what we're looking into. The data sheet needs to be purchased and we decided to let the code be as it is. This day has more obstacles than __day 2__ because we didn't have data sheet to refer to. We were looking for the RCC base address and the problem persists because it's undefined and without data sheet it's impossible to know. We decided to continue with our work and not let ourselves stop from pushing forward. Next meeting we're gonna further add more functions to our sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Day 4__: We finished all the functions that we needed and for our next meeting we're gonna be testing and writing it in git using Linux terminal. This day has less obstacles than the last few days since the code is almost done.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Day 5__: We posted our code into linux terminal and used the add command to be able to manage the version and committed. From 'gitk' command we saw the changes that we expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned the structure of programming microcontrollers with STM32 CUBE IDE. Also how to configure pins for I/O general purposes and the basic protocols to set up a microcontroller like setting up clock for ports aswell as pin modes, to write and read pins from a sensor and control LED lamps based in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- How much teamwork it required to plan the code and execute these tests because communication is one of the most important must haves as an embedded software developer.\n",
    "- Having fun with classmates at the same time that share same interests while learning, also developing trust for one another is an important key role to have a stable and maintainable software program.\n",
    "- You develop close relationships with those you work with over time just like a family.\n",
    "- Your responsibility gets challenged and it pushes everyone in the team to aim for success and work hard.\n",
    "- You learn how to solve problems and debug codes as an individual which enhances your skills as an embedded software developer.\n",
    "- You learn the fundamental skills of the language C in embedded software world.\n",
    "- Management and set up of microcontroller using STM32 e.g. assigning pins (output/input) and activating the system clock.\n",
    "- Having fun manipulating the code to get the desired outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- It was challenging to get the project started as we were starting from scratch.\n",
    "- It was difficult to implement the functions for parking space detector using ultrasonic sensor\n",
    "- Not having the opportunity to do real testing on physical microcontrollers and LED lamps to see if the code works as it should.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The project we chose was possible and went good as we planned. We've developed functions that stored vehicle parking spaces with array and removal as well as adding vehicles. We've implemented echo/trigger signals to stimulate the ultrasonic sensor. We've used LEDs: Red for occupied and Green for available. We also made a user interface display for the user to interact with and see. We initialized our sensor which we connected to a port and a clock with different pin modes (push pull/open drain). We used math algorithm to measure between the sensor and the object, we were able to manipulate the distance limit it has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible future opportunities are increased bond between the developers. There's always room for improvement in terms of accuracy and reliability by e.g. refining algorithms and sensor technologies to ensure better detection in various weather conditions, lighting situations and challenging parking environments. Make it integrate with autonomous vehicles as these types of vehicles are getting more sensational and growing in business, they rely heavily on accurate detection of their surroundings including parking spaces. Developing advanced parking space detection systems that seamlessly integrate with autonomous vehicles could enhance their ability to locate suitable parking spots and easily navigate through parking lots (more park efficiency).\n",
